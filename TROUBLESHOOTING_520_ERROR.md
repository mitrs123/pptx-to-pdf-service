# ‚ùå 520 Error - Quick Fix Guide

## What is a 520 Error?

A **520 error** is a Cloudflare error that occurs when:
- The origin server (Render) is not responding
- The service crashed during request
- The service spun down due to inactivity (free tier)
- Service timeout or memory issues

## üö® Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Warm Up the Service (Fastest Fix)

Before using the service, ping the health endpoint:

```bash
curl https://pptx-to-pdf-service.onrender.com/health
```

Wait for "ok" response, then try your conversion again.

---

### Solution 2: Setup Automatic Keep-Alive

Prevent the service from spinning down by pinging it every 10 minutes.

#### Option A: Use cron-job.org (Free)

1. Go to [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org)
2. Create free account
3. Add new cron job:
   - **Title:** Keep PPTX service alive
   - **URL:** `https://pptx-to-pdf-service.onrender.com/health`
   - **Schedule:** Every 10 minutes
   - **Request Method:** GET

#### Option B: Use GitHub Actions (Free)

Create `.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml`:

```yaml
name: Keep Service Alive

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/10 * * * *' # Every 10 minutes
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  ping:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Ping Service
        run: |
          curl https://pptx-to-pdf-service.onrender.com/health
```

#### Option C: Run Keep-Alive Script

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run keep-alive script (keep it running)
node scripts/keep-alive.js
```

### Solution 3: Upgrade Render Service (Best Long-term)

Free tier limitation:
- ‚ùå Spins down after 15 min inactivity
- ‚ùå 256MB memory limit
- ‚ùå Slow cold starts

Upgrade to **Starter Plan ($7/month)**:
- ‚úÖ Always-on (never spins down)
- ‚úÖ 512MB memory
- ‚úÖ Faster response times
- ‚úÖ Better reliability

**How to upgrade:**
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on your service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí Select "Starter" plan
4. Click "Apply"

---

### Solution 4: Increase Render Memory

If using free tier and hitting memory limits:

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Find "Memory Limit" (if available)
5. Increase to maximum (varies by plan)

---

## üîç Diagnosing the Issue

### Step 1: Check Service Status

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://pptx-to-pdf-service.onrender.com/health

# Expected response: "ok"
# If no response or error: Service is down
```

### Step 2: Check Render Logs

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on your service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for:
   - ‚úÖ "PPTX->PDF service listening on 3000" - Service is running
   - ‚ùå "ERROR" or "CRASH" - Service is crashing
   - ‚ùå "out of memory" - Need more RAM
   - ‚ùå "timeout" - Request took too long

### Step 3: Check File Size

Large PPTX files can cause 520 errors due to:
- Timeout (service takes too long to convert)
- Memory issues (service runs out of RAM)

**File size recommendations:**
- ‚úÖ Under 5MB: Should work fine
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 5-15MB: May timeout on free tier
- ‚ùå Over 15MB: Likely to crash on free tier

---

## üõ† Technical Fixes

### Fix 1: Increase Request Timeout

The service now has a 4-minute timeout. If your files need more time:

Edit `src/index.js`:
```javascript
const REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 600000; // 10 minutes (was 4 minutes)
```

### Fix 2: Add Retry Logic in Your Client Code

```javascript
async function convertWithRetry(s3Key, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      // First, ensure service is awake
      await fetch('https://pptx-to-pdf-service.onrender.com/health');
      
      // Wait a moment for service to fully wake up
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
      
      // Now do the conversion
      const response = await fetch(
        'https://pptx-to-pdf-service.onrender.com/convert',
        {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify({ s3Key })
        }
      );
      
      if (response.ok) {
        return await response.json();
      }
      
      throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      console.log(`Retry ${i + 1}/${maxRetries}...`);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
    }
  }
}
```

### Fix 3: Use Different Free Hosting

If Render is too problematic, consider alternatives:

**Railway (Free tier):**
- Better free tier than Render
- More reliable

**Fly.io (Free tier):**
- Generous free tier
- Always-on available

**Render Paid ($7/month):**
- Best option for production use
- Guaranteed uptime

## ‚úÖ Prevention Checklist

1. ‚úÖ Setup automatic keep-alive (ping every 10 minutes)
2. ‚úÖ Check file sizes (keep under 15MB)
3. ‚úÖ Add retry logic in client code
4. ‚úÖ Monitor Render logs regularly
5. ‚úÖ Upgrade to paid plan if used frequently
6. ‚úÖ Test with small files first

---

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

1. **Check service is running:**
   ```bash
   curl https://pptx-to-pdf-service.onrender.com/health
   ```

2. **Restart the service:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click "Manual Deploy"
   - Click "Apply"

3. **Check AWS credentials:**
   - Verify AWS credentials are correct
   - Ensure IAM permissions allow S3 access

4. **Test with smaller file:**
   - Try with a small PPTX (< 1MB) first
   - If works, issue is file-specific

5. **Contact support:**
   - Check Render support
   - Check AWS support (if S3 issue)

---

**Pro Tip:** The best solution is to upgrade to Render's paid plan ($7/month) for production use. Free tier is only suitable for testing/demo purposes.
